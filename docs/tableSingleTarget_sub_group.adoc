 2+|{var}int(*) target_identifier |Variable length vector used to store array of index of single target data detections.
 2+|{var}float(*) target_range |Variable length vector used to store array of range of single target data detections.
 2+|{var}float(*) target_angle |Variable length vector used to store variable length array of angle of single target detections.
 2+|{var}float(*) target_TS |Variable length vector used to store variable length array of Target Strength of single target detections.


e|Variables | |
 |{var}int single_target_count(ping_time, beam) |O |The number of single target detection in each beam/ping in the single_target_XXX variables. This value is not essential, but software that reads the vlen variables can use it to significantly improve data loading times.
 3+|{attr}:long_name = "Number of single target detection in each beam, per ping"
 3+|{attr}int :valid_min = 0

 |{var}target_identifier single_target_identifier(ping_time,beam) |MA |Label of single target detected and possibly tracked on multiple pings.
 3+|{attr}:long_name = "Index of single target detected"

 |{var}target_range single_target_range(ping_time,beam) |MA |Range from the transducer face where the single target detection criteria were encountered for the amplitude and the phase of the backscattered echoes. Calculation of the range is similar to detected_bottom_range defined in the BeamGroup with possible weighting of the range by the backscattervalue within the pulse shape.
 3+|{attr}:units = "m"
 3+|{attr}:long_name = "Range of single target detected"

 |{var}target_angle single_target_alongship_angle(ping_time,beam) |MA |Angle of single target detected in the minor beam coordinate.
 3+|{attr}:units = "arc_degree"
 3+|{attr}:long_name = "Single target arrival angle in the minor beam coordinate"
 3+|{attr}float :valid_range = −180.0, 180.0

 |{var}target_angle single_target_athwartship_angle(ping_time,beam) |MA |Angle of single target detected in the major beam coordinate.
 3+|{attr}:units = "arc_degree"
 3+|{attr}:long_name = "Single target arrival angle in the major beam coordinate"
 3+|{attr}float :valid_range = −180.0, 180.0

 |{var}target_TS compensated_TS(ping_time,beam,frequency) |MA |Calculated beam compensated Target Strength.
 3+|{attr}:units = "dB"
 3+|{attr}:long_name = "Calculated Target Strength after compensation for off-axis angle for each frequency of the receive echo from spectral analysis of the FM pulse or frequency of the CW pulse"
 
 |{var}target_TS uncompensated_TS(ping_time,beam,frequency) |MA |Calculated beam uncompensated Target Strength.
 3+|{attr}:units = "dB"
 3+|{attr}:long_name = "Calculated Target Strength uncompensated for off-axis angle for each frequency of the receive echo from spectral analysis of the FM pulse or frequency of the CW pulse"
